"I've done some debugging on this issue. 
CGDisplayBaseAddress() has been deprecated in 10.6 and while it still exists on 10.7, it now returns NULL instead of the display's base address. SDL_SetVideoMode() ends up calling a number of deprecated CG functions via the Quartz implementation including CGDisplayBaseAddress(). It is SDL_SetVideoMode()'s call to SDL_ClearSurface() that actually causes the crash when it tries to clear the frame buffer memory at address zero. 

A new set of APIs has been added as of 10.6 and while they let you capture a display, they do not allow direct frame buffer access. Quartz or OpenGL are the only methods that can update a captured display. 

The work to switch to the new APIs in the context of SDL is not trivial. 

I downloaded a snapshot of the SDL 1.3 sources and see that, sadly, the Mac OS X implementation is still using the deprecated functions. "

so above problem appears to be becayse Aviron orig dev on Mac Mini running 10.6, and now my Air is 10.7, and on 10.7, OS X changed behavior of the CGDisplayBaseAddress fn to return NULL instead of a valid address

"So, for full screen capability on OS X 10.7, it will probably be necessary to upgrade to SDL 1.2.14 (currently in the roto branch.)"
"In order for that to happen, the movie playback/SMPEG issues need to be addressed. Prior to that being finished, it would probably be good to either:
    disable full screen mode on 10.7 for the time being or,
    detect the null pointer and handle it better than hanging, effectively disabling full screen mode on 10.7"

fix for above was to remove FULLSCREEN and HWBUFF from the pygame display mode params, so Ganymede just ran in a window. i had to tweak gany's font init code prev to make the font errors go away. and I had to move down where the mixer.init was called
